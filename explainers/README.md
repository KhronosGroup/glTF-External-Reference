glTF Reference Format (glTFX) is the specification for a new file type in the glTF ecosystem for efficient composition of multiple glTF assets.

This section explainers many aspects of the specification. It was developed prior to written the glTFX Specification documents and frequently presents multiple solutions that the specification editor team may choose to restrict.

These documents are not the specification.

## Explainers

* [Lighting](lighting.md) - Describes several use cases of multiple light sources and how they may impact additional objects in the scene.

* [Level of Detail](level-of-detail.md) - Describes situations where a model must change because more or less detail is needed. Several different measures for determining transition points are discussed

* [Billboard](billboard.md) - _not yet written_
