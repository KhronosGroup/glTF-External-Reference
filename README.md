glTF Reference Format (glTFX - formely called "glTF Experience Format (glXF)") is the specification for a new file type in the glTF ecosystem for efficient composition of multiple glTF assets.

The specification documents described here are the original submission from 2022. The format has undergone significant conceptual changes from then; however, the specification documents have not yet been updated. 

Documents that refer to "glTF Experience Format" or "glFX" are old. No work should be done on those documents that extends or corrects them. We anticipate starting new replcement documents in 2H2024.

## Specification (OLD)

* [glTF Experience Format (glXF) Registry](specification/README.md)
* [glTF Experience Format (glXF) Extension Registry](extensions/README.md)
